# Citation Graph Analysis

## Overview
Citation Graph Analysis is a C#-based academic network analysis system that builds a citation graph from structured JSON data and performs graph-based impact analysis.

The system models publications as nodes and citations as directed edges, enabling structural and centrality-based evaluation.

---

## Features
- JSON-based citation data parsing
- Directed citation graph construction
- H-Index calculation
- Betweenness Centrality computation
- K-Core decomposition
- Graph export functionality

---

## Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET
- JSON parsing
- Graph data structures

---

## Graph Algorithms Implemented
- H-Index computation for academic impact measurement
- Betweenness Centrality for influence detection
- K-Core analysis for network cohesion analysis

---

## Data Model
The system reads structured JSON input representing:
- Authors / publications
- Citation relationships
- Metadata information

These are transformed into a directed graph structure.

---

## Purpose
Developed as an academic Software Laboratory project to explore:
- Graph theory applications
- Centrality measures
- Network topology analysis
- Academic impact modeling
